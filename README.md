If you found this connected to TeaCupSMP, please read below!

This is where the code for the website is kept, and as i don't have a pro github account, i can't have it be a private repo.
You are not meant to go into the code to find clues!
It will just make the actual progression boring. So please, for the sake of fun, don't look into the code of the website.

Nothing will make you have to go through the code of the actual website. So anything connected to this repo, is off-limits to the ARG!
Thank you.
