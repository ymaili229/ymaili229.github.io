            <h2 class="quantico-bold center">About ORACLE Systems</h2>
            <p class="quantico-regular info-main center">ORACLE Systems was established to develop large-scale analytical platforms capable of assisting organizations facing complex,<br>high-impact decision environments.<br><br>From its inception, ORACLE Systems operated at the intersection of data science, infrastructure analysis, and policy support.<br>Our objective was not to replace human judgment, but to provide decision-makers with clearer insight during periods where uncertainty<br> carried global consequences.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="info rounded">
            <h2 class="quantico-bold center">Our Approach</h2>
            <p class="quantico-regular info-main center">ORACLE Systems platforms were designed to synthesize vast and often conflicting data sources into coherent analytical models.<br>These models emphasized trend identification, scenario projection, and risk assessment.<br><br>All outputs were delivered as advisory material. Final authority remained with human operators at every stage of deployment.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="info rounded">
            <h2 class="quantico-bold center">Oversight and Responsibility</h2>
            <p class="quantico-regular info-main center">Recognizing the potential impact of large-scale analytical systems, ORACLE Systems implemented<br>extensive oversight structures throughout development and operation.<br><br>Independent review boards, ethical committees, and regulatory liaisons were embedded into the lifecycle of all ORACLE projects.<br>These bodies were responsible for evaluating system behavior, reviewing recommendations, and enforcing operational boundaries.<br><br>Safeguards were not an afterthought. They were foundational.</p>

        <div class="info rounded">
            <h2 class="quantico-bold center">Conclusion of Operations</h2>
            <p class="quantico-regular info-main center">The primary ORACLE analytical program concluded operations following the successful completion of its mandate.<br><br>After comprehensive internal review and external consultation, all active systems were formally decommissioned.<br>Remaining materials are retained solely for archival, compliance, and historical reference.<br><br>ORACLE Systems does not operate autonomous systems and is not engaged in ongoing analytical deployment.</p>

        <div class="info rounded">
            <h2 class="quantico-bold center">Acknowledgment</h2>
            <p class="quantico-regular info-main center">The challenges ORACLE Systems was created to address were unprecedented. The individuals involved--engineers, analysts, researchers,<br> and reviewers--worked under extraordinary pressure and with the intent to prevent harm.<br><br>While public discourse surrounding large-scale analytical systems remains complex, ORACLE Systems stands by the<br>professionalism and good faith of those who contributed to its work.</p>
